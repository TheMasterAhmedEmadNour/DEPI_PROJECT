   <h1 align="center">DevOps Engineer,Project: Automated Deployment Pipeline with Jenkins and Docker</h1>


________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


Objective: Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker,
and Ansible.
Description: Develop a pipeline to automate the build, testing, and
deployment of a sample application. Utilize Jenkins for continuous
integration, Docker for containerization, and Ansible for configuration
management. Implement automated testing and deployment to a cloud
environment.
Technologies to use: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, CI/CD, Cloud
Deployment.

   <h1 align="center">Week 1: Initial Setup & Planning</h1>
   
Tasks:
• Install Jenkins and Docker: Set up the Jenkins server and Docker on local or cloud
environments.
• Create a basic Dockerized application: Develop a simple application (e.g., a web
app) and Dockerize it.
• Set up Ansible: Install Ansible for configuration management.
• Pipeline Plan: Plan the structure of the CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy) and
document tasks.
Deliverables:
• Jenkins and Docker environments installed and configured.
• Dockerized application running locally.
• Basic Ansible setup.
• CI/CD pipeline plan documented.

   <h1 align="center">Week 2: Jenkins & CI Integration</h1>

Tasks:
• Create Jenkins Jobs: Configure Jenkins to build the Dockerized application.
• Integrate Git: Set up GitHub or GitLab repository and integrate with Jenkins for
continuous integration.
• Automated Testing: Add basic testing (e.g., unit tests) into the Jenkins pipeline for
automated builds.
• Set Up Notifications: Configure email/Slack notifications for pipeline success or
failure.
Deliverables:
• Working Jenkins pipeline triggered by Git commits.
• Jenkins job that builds Docker images.•
•
Automated testing included in the pipeline.
Notifications configured for pipeline updates.

   <h1 align="center">Week 3: Docker& Deployment</h1>

Tasks:
• Integrate Docker Hub or private registry: Push Docker images to Docker Hub or a
private registry.
• Configure Ansible for Deployment: Write Ansible playbooks to automate
application deployment to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP).
• Deployment Testing: Test deployment process with Docker and Ansible to ensure
smooth automation.
Deliverables:
• Docker images automatically pushed to Docker Hub or a registry.
• Ansible playbooks ready and tested.
• Successful deployment of the application to a cloud server.

   <h1 align="center">Week 4: CI/CD Refinement & Final Testing</h1>
   
Tasks:
• Kubernetes Integration: Optional task — configure Kubernetes to orchestrate the
deployment of Docker containers if desired.
• Refine the Pipeline: Refine Jenkins jobs for efficiency (e.g., parallel stages,
caching).
• Full Testing and Deployment: Conduct full tests of the CI/CD pipeline, from code
commit to deployment.
• Documentation: Complete documentation of the project, including pipeline
design, deployment process, and any issues faced.
Deliverables:
• Kubernetes integration (if applicable).
• Fully refined CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.
• Documented CI/CD pipeline process.
• Final deployment verified and tested on the cloud.
