## üßê objective <a name = "about"></a>

Objective: Implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, Docker,
and Ansible.
Description: Develop a pipeline to automate the build, testing, and
deployment of a sample application. Utilize Jenkins for continuous
integration, Docker for containerization, and Ansible for configuration
management. Implement automated testing and deployment to a cloud
environment.
Technologies to use: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, CI/CD, Cloud
Deployment.

##  Week 1: Initial Setup & Planning<a name = "demo"></a>

Tasks:
‚Ä¢ Install Jenkins and Docker: Set up the Jenkins server and Docker on local or cloud
environments.
‚Ä¢ Create a basic Dockerized application: Develop a simple application (e.g., a web
app) and Dockerize it.
‚Ä¢ Set up Ansible: Install Ansible for configuration management.
‚Ä¢ Pipeline Plan: Plan the structure of the CI/CD pipeline (build, test, deploy) and
document tasks.
Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Jenkins and Docker environments installed and configured.
‚Ä¢ Dockerized application running locally.
‚Ä¢ Basic Ansible setup.
‚Ä¢ CI/CD pipeline plan documented.

## üí≠ Week 2: Jenkins & CI Integration <a name = "working"></a>

Tasks:
‚Ä¢ Create Jenkins Jobs: Configure Jenkins to build the Dockerized application.
‚Ä¢ Integrate Git: Set up GitHub or GitLab repository and integrate with Jenkins for
continuous integration.
‚Ä¢ Automated Testing: Add basic testing (e.g., unit tests) into the Jenkins pipeline for
automated builds.
‚Ä¢ Set Up Notifications: Configure email/Slack notifications for pipeline success or
failure.
Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Working Jenkins pipeline triggered by Git commits.
‚Ä¢ Jenkins job that builds Docker images.‚Ä¢
‚Ä¢
Automated testing included in the pipeline.
Notifications configured for pipeline updates.

## üéà Week 3: Docker& Deployment <a name = "usage"></a>
Tasks:
‚Ä¢ Integrate Docker Hub or private registry: Push Docker images to Docker Hub or a
private registry.
‚Ä¢ Configure Ansible for Deployment: Write Ansible playbooks to automate
application deployment to a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, GCP).
‚Ä¢ Deployment Testing: Test deployment process with Docker and Ansible to ensure
smooth automation.
Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Docker images automatically pushed to Docker Hub or a registry.
‚Ä¢ Ansible playbooks ready and tested.
‚Ä¢ Successful deployment of the application to a cloud server.



## üèÅ Week 4: CI/CD Refinement & Final Testing <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Tasks:
‚Ä¢ Kubernetes Integration: Optional task ‚Äî configure Kubernetes to orchestrate the
deployment of Docker containers if desired.
‚Ä¢ Refine the Pipeline: Refine Jenkins jobs for efficiency (e.g., parallel stages,
caching).
‚Ä¢ Full Testing and Deployment: Conduct full tests of the CI/CD pipeline, from code
commit to deployment.
‚Ä¢ Documentation: Complete documentation of the project, including pipeline
design, deployment process, and any issues faced.
Deliverables:
‚Ä¢ Kubernetes integration (if applicable).
‚Ä¢ Fully refined CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.
‚Ä¢ Documented CI/CD pipeline process.
‚Ä¢ Final deployment verified and tested on the cloud.
